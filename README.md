# Application:
In the app automator you can macros also known as workflows. With this python project you can convert these commands to code so they are more flexiable to work with.
This allows different macros to be triggered depending on different conditions; for example you could have an ai that examines the screen in a video game for when it turns night
and you could have it automatically run a marco using python code. This could be used for endless things, namely being farms in numerous games.

# Current fetures:
- Translates hotkeys/multip input lines
- Tanslates held down keys

# Planned to be added:
- Cursor clicks

# How to use:
- Record a workflow in automator app preinstalled on every mac
- Click on a command
- Copy it and past it into the src/inputs.txt (you might want to delete example text)
- Run the python file (in vscode next to the play button theres a down arrow, run python file)
- In the console it will have formated the code, which you can paste into any python project (make sure you import "pyautogui" for it to work)
